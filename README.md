# Non-stationary-linear-bandits
Solving the problem of Non-stationary linear bandits using Ramanujan Periodicity Transforms

The code in the repository was used to generate figures in the ICASSP paper titled 'Non-Stationary Bandits with Periodic Behavior: Harnessing Ramanujan Periodicity Transforms to Conquer Time-Varying Challenges' which can be found on this link [here][https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10447590].
